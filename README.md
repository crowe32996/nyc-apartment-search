# NYC Apartment Search Dashboard

## Overview

This project provides a dynamic apartment search dashboard for NYC and surrounding areas. The end-to-end pipeline integrates the following:

- Apartment listings via the Realtor.com API 
- Safety data by zip code (static CSV)
- Subway location data (static CSV)
- Snowflake and dbt for data warehousing and transformations
- Looker Studio dashboard for interactive exploration and weighing of apartment factors

Note that in order to manage API request limits, the search is limited to the following pre-filtering:

- 2+ bedrooms
- 1+ bathroom
- 900+ Square Feet
- Between $4000 and $8000 per month (arbitrarily chosen as wide range for most 2+ bedroom units, will adjust as I include studio and 1 bedroom apartments in the future)
- Within 5 mi radius of Downtown Brooklyn (arbitrarily chosen as somewhat central across all five boroughs and surrounding cities)
- Washer/dryer in the building

Future iterations will provide additional API request limit handling, to incorporate studio and 1 bedroom apartments, and to allow the user to  filter for factors such as washer/dryer, outdoor space, etc.

- Modular dbt project for clean data transformations
- Snowflake data warehouse integration
